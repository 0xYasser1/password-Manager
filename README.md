In today's digital world, a local password manager is crucial for security and privacy. Unlike cloud-based options, a local manager stores passwords offline, reducing exposure to cyberattacks and data breaches. It ensures complete control over sensitive information, preventing third parties from accessing or misusing it. Additionally, local storage protects against phishing attacks and malware that target online databases. With no reliance on internet connectivity, a local password manager remains accessible even during network outages or cloud service failures. It also eliminates the risk of subscription fees and offers the flexibility to implement strong encryption and secure local backups. By developing a personal password manager, users can customize security measures to fit their needs while maintaining full control over their data
